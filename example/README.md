# Browser C# Example

<small>[Link to live example](https://Ã¥sberg.net/browser-csharp/)</small>

This is an example project showcasing how to use the main Browser C# package
together with webpack.

To try it out, run `npm install` to set up everything properly and then
`npm start` to start a webpack dev server.

Running this example relies on the main package being built. `npm install` of
this package should take care of that too. But if you encounter any problems
with missing dependencies, building the main package is a good way to start.
